#Expressions are just values combined with operators and they always evaluate down to single value
#A data type is a category for values and every value belong to exactly one data type
#Data type are very important because they will tell us what opeartions can be perform on the operator

#Integers : the integers or int data type indicates values that are whole nummbers
#Float : nummbers with a decimal point such as 3.14 are callled floating point numbers or float
#Strings : A string in python is a sequence of charcaters which are always surrounded by single quoet or double quote

#Python programs can also have text values called string or strs

#Always surround your stirng in single quote(') or diuble quote(") characters (As in 'Hello'
# or "Goodbye to the cruel world") so pyhton knows where the string begin and ends

# you can even have a string with no charcaters in it ' ' called blank string.
# you can perfoem operations on string like concatenation and string repplication.

print(type('hello'))
print(type('100'))
print(type(100))
print('Hello world')
print("seemi"+"kumari") #string concatenation
print("hello"*5)  #string replication
#print("hello" +5)  # we can not add string to int data type
