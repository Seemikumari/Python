#Expression in Python
#In python 2+2 is called expression which is most basic kind of programming
# instruction in a language

#Expression consist of values(such as 2 ) and operators such as( +) and they can always evaluate down to a single value.

#That means you can use expressions anywhere in python code that you could also use as value
# A single value with no operators is also considered as expression thiugh it evaluates only to itself.

# a+b addition
# a/b true division
# a// b floor division
# a % b modulus
# a** b exponentiation

# The order of opeartions(also called precedence) of python math operatoes is  similar to that of mathematics(BODMAS)
#The ** operator is evaluated first , then *, / , // and % operators are evaluated next , from left to right and the  + and - operators are evaluated last(also from left to right).
# we can use parenthesis () to override the usual precedence if you need to.
