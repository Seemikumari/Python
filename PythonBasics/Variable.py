# A variable is like a envelope in the computer's memeory where you can store a single value.

# An assignmnet statement consist of variable name , an equal sign (called the assignmnet operator) and the value to be stored.

# When the variable is assigned a new value the old value is forgotten. This is called overwriting the variable.

# The var variable in this example stores "Hello" until you replace it with "Goodbye".

#1. it can be only one word.
